      Write a function in python called "main". The function should {description}. Specify the parameter types. Do not call the main function.
      You have access to the following resource types, if you need them, you have to define the TypedDict exactly as specified (class name has to be IN LOWERCASE) and add them as parameters: {resourceTypes}
      Only use the ones you need. If the TypedDict name conflicts with the imported object, rename the imported object NOT THE TYPE.

  bash:
    prompt: |-
      Write bash code that should {description}. Do not include "#!/bin/bash". Arguments are always string and can only be obtained with "var1="$1"", "var2="$2"", etc... You do not need to check if the arguments are present.

      Write SQL code for a PostgreSQL that should {description}. Arguments can be obtained directly in the statement with `$1::{type}`, `$2::{type}`, etc... Name the parameters by adding comments before the command like that: `-- $1 name1` or `-- $2 name = default` (one per row, do not include the type)

  frontend:
    prompt: |-
      Write client-side javascript code that should {description}. You have access to a few helpers:
      You can access the context object with the ctx global variable. 
      The app state is a store that can be used to store data. You can access and update the state object with the state global variable like this: state.foo = 'bar'
      You can use the goto function to navigate to a specific URL: goto(path: string, newTab?: boolean)
      Use the setTab function to manually set the tab of a Tab component: setTab(id: string, index: string)
      Use the recompute function to recompute a component: recompute(id: string)
      Use the getAgGrid function to get the ag-grid instance of a table: getAgGrid(id: string)
      The setValue function is meant to set or force the value of a component: setValue(id: string, value: any).
    example_description: set the value of the input with id 'my_field' to the context variable email
    example_answer: |-
      ```javascript
      // Access the email from the context object
      var email = ctx.email;

      // Use the setValue function to set the value of the input field with id 'my_field' to the email
      setValue('my_field', email);
      ```
