# Documentation

- Documentation should be written assuming the developer working on Svelvet has coding experience equivalent to six weeks of bootcamp.
- If you write documents in tsDoc format, you can use TypeDoc to generate documentation automatically. For instructions on how to use TypeDoc, see Tutorials.md
- Write READMEs for every feature so that future teams can understand how they work. Put your email down if you want to be a resource for future teams.
