/*


Important functions (in order of how likely I think you are to use them):

findStore(canvasId: string)
- Input: canvasId. There can be multiple Svelvet canvases on the same page, and each has their own store
- Returns: store
- Notes: You will need to call this function on every component you make

getNodes(store, filter)
- Description: this function returns of list of Node objects
- Input: store: the store where you get the list of Node objects from
-        filter: an object where you can filter the array. For example, if you want to find nodes with an id of 'sdf-2d3fs' and positionX=35, then you
                 would set filter = {id: 'sdf-2d3fs, positionX: 35}. 
                 Right now, you can only test for equality.
- Notes: This is a very mongoose way of retrieving information. Given the relational nature of our stores, maybe it would be better to use an SQL-like syntax
         This array is non-reactive (ie, you cannot use information from this array to force a re-render of a Svelte component)

createStoreEmpty(canvasId: string)
- Input: canvasId. 
- Returns: store
- Notes. This should be called once every time you initialize a new Svelvet canvas, (ie, only in the Svelvet.svelte file)

populateSvelvetStoreFromUserInput(canvasId, nodes, edges)
- canvasId: this the the canvasId of the Svelvet component you are creating a store for
- nodes: this is an array of objects containing node info that is defined by the user. NOTE THAT THE STRUCTURE DIFFERS FROM THE NODES CLASS
         The whole point of populateSvelvetStoreFromUserInput is to convert nodes into proper Svelvet Node objects. An example of nodes is in 
         $routes/testingplayground/index.svelte
- edges: same as nodes, this is an array of objects containing edge info THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE EDGE CLASS.
- Returns: store
