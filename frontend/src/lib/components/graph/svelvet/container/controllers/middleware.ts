/**
 * convertAnchorPositionsToCallbacks
 * @description
 * WHY: This function is in order to maintain compliance with earlier versions of Svelvet.
 * HISTORY: In Svelvet<=5, anchor points were hard-coded onto each node. Each node had a "sourcePosition"
 * "targetPosition" where the edges would be attached. In Svelvet6, the store was re-designed
 * from the ground up into an object-relational data model where anchor points could be attached
 * at any point on the node using callbacks. This enabled features such as custom edge position,
 * adaptive edge positioning, and dynamic edges.
 * The purpose of this function is to parse the old way of specifying edge positions (as two source/target
 * anchors on the node) into the Svelvet6 (where anchors are separate objects) in order to maintain a
 * consistent user experience. However, we suggest that this functionality (parsing Svelvet5 syntax into
 * Svelvet6 syntax) be removed completely in favor of only using Svelvet6 syntax in order to reduce edge cases.
