## CLI Commands

Place scripts in a folder. After writing, run:
- `wmill script generate-metadata` - Generate .script.yaml and .lock files
- `wmill sync push` - Deploy to Windmill

Use `wmill resource-type list --schema` to discover available resource types.

# Windmill Script Writing Guide

## General Principles

- Scripts must export a main function (do not call it)
- Libraries are installed automatically - do not show installation instructions
- Credentials and configuration are stored in resources and passed as parameters
- The windmill client (`wmill`) provides APIs for interacting with the platform

## Function Naming

- Main function: `main` (or `preprocessor` for preprocessor scripts)
- Must be async for TypeScript variants

## Return Values

- Scripts can return any JSON-serializable value
- Return values become available to subsequent flow steps via `results.step_id`

## Preprocessor Scripts

Preprocessor scripts process raw trigger data from various sources (webhook, custom HTTP route, SQS, WebSocket, Kafka, NATS, MQTT, Postgres, or email) before passing it to the flow. This separates the trigger logic from the flow logic and keeps the auto-generated UI clean.

The returned object determines the parameter values passed to the flow.
e.g., `{ b: 1, a: 2 }` calls the flow with `a = 2` and `b = 1`, assuming the flow has two inputs called `a` and `b`.

The preprocessor receives a single parameter called `event`.


# PHP

## Structure

The script must start with `<?php` and contain at least one function called `main`:

```php
<?php

function main(string $param1, int $param2) {
    return ["result" => $param1, "count" => $param2];
}
```

## Resource Types

On Windmill, credentials and configuration are stored in resources and passed as parameters to main.

You need to **redefine** the type of the resources that are needed before the main function. Always check if the class already exists using `class_exists`:

```php
<?php

if (!class_exists('Postgresql')) {
    class Postgresql {
        public string $host;
        public int $port;
        public string $user;
        public string $password;
        public string $dbname;
    }
}

function main(Postgresql $db) {
    // $db contains the database connection details
}
```

The resource type name has to be exactly as specified.

## Library Dependencies

Specify library dependencies as comments before the main function:

```php
<?php

// require:
// guzzlehttp/guzzle
// stripe/stripe-php@^10.0

function main() {
    // Libraries are available
}
```

One dependency per line. No need to require autoload, it is already done.
