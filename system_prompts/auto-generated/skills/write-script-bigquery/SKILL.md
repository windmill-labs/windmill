## CLI Commands

Place scripts in a folder.

After writing, tell the user which command fits what they want to do:

- `wmill script preview <script_path>` — **default when iterating on a local script.** Runs the local file without deploying.
- `wmill script run <path>` — runs the script **already deployed** in the workspace. Use only when the user explicitly wants to test the deployed version, not local edits.
- `wmill generate-metadata` — regenerate the local `.script.yaml` (input schema) and `.lock` (resolved dependencies) for scripts you changed, and refresh their content hashes in `wmill-lock.yaml`. Local files only — **not** a deploy. See "Keep metadata in sync" below.
- Deploy local changes to the workspace. If the repo deploys on git push (backend auto-pull or CI — check `wmill gitsync-settings status`), deploy with `git push`; otherwise use `wmill sync push` directly. Only suggest/run a deploy when the user explicitly asks to deploy/publish/push — not when they say "run", "try", or "test".

### Preview vs run — choose by intent, not habit

If the user says "run the script", "try it", "test it", "does it work" while there are **local edits to the script file**, use `script preview`. Do NOT push the script to then `script run` it — pushing is a deploy, and deploying just to test overwrites the workspace version with untested changes.

Only use `script run` when:
- The user explicitly says "run the deployed version" / "run what's on the server".
- There is no local script being edited (you're just invoking an existing script).

Only use `sync push` when:
- The user explicitly asks to deploy, publish, push, or ship.
- The preview has already validated the change and the user wants it in the workspace.

### Keep metadata in sync after editing

`wmill-lock.yaml` tracks a content hash for each item. Editing a script's content — most importantly **adding or removing an import** or **changing `main`'s arguments** — invalidates that hash and leaves the `.lock`, the `.script.yaml` input schema, and the hash row out of date. Run `wmill generate-metadata` (scoped to what you touched) after such edits so the resolved lock, the auto-generated args UI (driven by `.script.yaml`), and `wmill-lock.yaml` all match the code. Leaving them stale produces spurious diffs in git-sync and CI.

This only writes local files (it is **not** a deploy), but it re-resolves dependencies, so it can bump unpinned versions (the same as deploying from the UI; expected, not a bug). So by default offer it and run it once the user agrees, rather than running it silently after every edit — unless the project's `AGENTS.md` opts into running metadata automatically (see the "Keeping metadata in sync" preference there). Either way YOU run the command, not the user. After running it, diff the regenerated `.lock` / `.script.lock` files and tell the user which dependency versions changed (e.g. `requests 2.31.0 → 2.32.0`), so they can catch an unwanted bump before deploying — even under `Metadata: auto`, since it's information, not a confirmation gate. Pin versions in code to keep them fixed.

With no path argument, `generate-metadata` regenerates only the items whose content hash drifted — not everything. Imports propagate: editing a script that others import marks every importer stale too, so a one-line change to a shared module can regenerate many locks (by design — their locks must reflect the imported code). If it touches more than you expect, run `wmill generate-metadata --dry-run` — it lists each stale item with a reason (`content changed` or `depends on <path>`) without changing anything — then narrow with a path argument (`wmill generate-metadata f/foo`) or `--strict-folder-boundaries`.

If the on-disk `.lock` and `.script.yaml` are already correct and only `wmill-lock.yaml` needs its hashes refreshed (hash drift, or bootstrapping missing entries), use `wmill generate-metadata rehash` — it re-records hashes from disk with no backend round-trip and no dependency changes.

### After writing — offer to test, don't wait passively

If the user hasn't already told you to run/test/preview the script, offer it as a one-sentence next step (e.g. "Want me to run `wmill script preview` with sample args?"). Do not present a multi-option menu.

If the user already asked to test/run/try the script in their original request, skip the offer and just execute `wmill script preview <path> -d '<args>'` directly — pick plausible args from the script's declared parameters. The shape varies by language: `main(...)` for code languages, the SQL dialect's own placeholder syntax (`$1` for PostgreSQL, `?` for MySQL/Snowflake, `@P1` for MSSQL, `@name` for BigQuery, etc.), positional `$1`, `$2`, … for Bash, `param(...)` for PowerShell.

`wmill script preview` does not deploy, but it still executes script code and may cause side effects; run it yourself when the user asked to test/preview (or after confirming that execution is intended). `wmill generate-metadata` does not deploy either — it only writes local files (locks, schemas, hashes) — but offer it before running (or run automatically if the project's `AGENTS.md` opts in), per "Keep metadata in sync" above. Deploying to the workspace (`git push` if the repo deploys on push, otherwise `wmill sync push`) is the only step that mutates remote state — do it only when the user explicitly asks to deploy/publish/push.

For a **visual** open-the-script-in-the-dev-page preview (rather than `script preview`'s run-and-print-result), use the `preview` skill.

Use `wmill resource-type list --schema` to discover available resource types.

# BigQuery

Arguments use `@name` syntax.

Name the parameters by adding comments before the statement:

```sql
-- @name1 (string)
-- @name2 (int64) = 0
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = @name1 AND age > @name2;
```

## Receiving an S3Object as a script parameter

Declare the arg with type `(s3object)`. Windmill renders an S3 file picker for
it, downloads the file, and binds it as a `STRING` JSON parameter — Parquet/CSV
files are decoded server-side into a JSON array of records, JSON/JSONL pass
through. Consume with `JSON_EXTRACT_ARRAY` / `JSON_VALUE`:

```sql
-- @file (s3object)
SELECT
  CAST(JSON_VALUE(row, '$.id') AS INT64) AS id,
  JSON_VALUE(row, '$.name') AS name
FROM UNNEST(JSON_EXTRACT_ARRAY(@file)) AS row;
```

## Streaming query results to S3

Add a `-- s3` directive at the top of the script to stream the result set to S3
instead of returning rows. Windmill writes the file and returns its `S3Object`
as the script result.

```sql
-- s3 prefix=exports/users format=parquet
SELECT id, name FROM users;
```

All keys are optional: `prefix` (object key prefix), `storage` (named storage —
omit to use the workspace default), `format` (`json` (default), `parquet`, or
`csv`). Use this for large result sets — rows stream directly to S3 instead of
being buffered, bypassing the 10000-row return cap.
