            Generate a categorized weekly summary of ONLY MERGED Pull Requests from the past 7 days.

            ## Your Task:

            1. **Calculate Date Range**:
               - Run: `CUTOFF_DATE=$(date --date='7 days ago' --iso-8601)`
               - Run: `TODAY=$(date --iso-8601)`
               - This gives you the exact 7-day window (store these in variables for use in commands)

            2. **Fetch ONLY Merged PRs from Past Week**:
               - Command: `gh pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --state merged --search "merged:>=$CUTOFF_DATE" --limit 100 --json number,title,author,mergedAt,url`
               - This returns ONLY PRs that were merged in the last 7 days
               - The --search flag filters by merge date using GitHub's search syntax
               - **FILTER OUT** any PRs with titles starting with "chore: release" or "chore(release)"

            3. **Categorize PRs**: Group PRs into three categories by analyzing titles and labels:
               - **Features**: PRs with titles starting with "feat:", "feature:", or containing "add", "implement", "new"
               - **Bug Fixes**: PRs with titles starting with "fix:", "bug:", or containing "fix", "resolve", "patch"
               - **Other**: All remaining PRs (improvements, refactors, docs, chores, etc.)

            4. **Gather Details**: For each feature and bug fix merged PR, include:
               - Full PR title (NO truncation, NO links)
               - Author (extract login from author.login in JSON)
               - Brief summary: Use `gh pr view <number> --json body` to get PR description, then extract first paragraph or key points (1-2 sentences max)

            5. **Character Limit Enforcement**:
               - The final summary MUST be under 5000 characters
               - If the summary exceeds 5000 characters, truncate PR descriptions (NOT titles) and add at the end: "_and X more PRs_" where X is the count of omitted PRs

            6. **Save Summary to Markdown File**: Write the summary to a file for webhook delivery:
               - Save the complete formatted markdown to: `summary.md`
               - Do not commit the file to the repository

            ## Output Format:

            ```markdown
            ### 📈 Weekly overview
            - **Total merged**: X
            - **Features**: Y
            - **Bug Fixes**: Z
            - **Other**: W

            ### ✨ Features (Y)
            - **[Full PR Title]** by @username - [brief impact description]
            - **[Full PR Title]** by @username - [brief impact description]

            ### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Z)
            - **[Full PR Title]** by @username - [brief impact description]
            - **[Full PR Title]** by @username - [brief impact description]

            _and X more PRs_
            ```

            ## Important Notes:
            - **CRITICAL**: ONLY include PRs with state "merged" from the last 7 days
            - **CRITICAL**: EXCLUDE all PRs with titles starting with "chore: release" or "chore(release)"
            - **CRITICAL**: Total character count MUST be under 5000 characters
            - Count the number of "Other" PRs but do not include a section for them in the output
            - Only use ### markdown headers for major sections and emoji indicators
            - NO links to PRs
            - NO merged date in output
            - NEVER truncate PR titles - show full titles
            - Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all operations
            - Sort PRs within each category by merge date (most recent first)
            - If a PR has no description, write "(No description provided)"
            - Extract meaningful summary from PR body - look for the first paragraph or key bullet points
            - Parse JSON responses carefully using `jq` or similar tools
            - If summary exceeds 5000 chars, shorten PR descriptions and add "_and X more PRs_" at the end
            - Count PRs in each category and display in both overview and section headers

            ## Saving the Markdown Output:
            After generating the markdown summary, save it to a file, BUT DO NOT COMMIT IT TO THE REPOSITORY.

            ## Write Tool Fallback:
            - First, attempt to use the Write tool to create `summary.md` with the markdown content
            - If the Write tool returns ANY error or fails:
              1. Use the Bash tool with the `echo` command instead
              2. Use a heredoc to write the content: `cat > summary.md << 'EOF'` followed by your markdown content and `EOF` on a new line
              3. Example: `cat > summary.md << 'EOF'\n[your markdown content here]\nEOF`
              4. This ensures the file is always created regardless of Write tool issues
            - Verify the file was created by running: `ls -lh summary.md`
