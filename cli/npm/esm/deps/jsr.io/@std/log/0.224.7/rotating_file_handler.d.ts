/**
 * This handler extends the functionality of the {@linkcode FileHandler} by
 * "rotating" the log file when it reaches a certain size. `maxBytes` specifies
 * the maximum size in bytes that the log file can grow to before rolling over
 * to a new one. If the size of the new log message plus the current log file
 * size exceeds `maxBytes` then a roll-over is triggered. When a roll-over
 * occurs, before the log message is written, the log file is renamed and
 * appended with `.1`. If a `.1` version already existed, it would have been
 * renamed `.2` first and so on. The maximum number of log files to keep is
 * specified by `maxBackupCount`. After the renames are complete the log message
 * is written to the original, now blank, file.
 *
 * Example: Given `log.txt`, `log.txt.1`, `log.txt.2` and `log.txt.3`, a
 * `maxBackupCount` of 3 and a new log message which would cause `log.txt` to
 * exceed `maxBytes`, then `log.txt.2` would be renamed to `log.txt.3` (thereby
 * discarding the original contents of `log.txt.3` since 3 is the maximum number
 * of backups to keep), `log.txt.1` would be renamed to `log.txt.2`, `log.txt`
 * would be renamed to `log.txt.1` and finally `log.txt` would be created from
 * scratch where the new log message would be written.
 *
 * This handler uses a buffer for writing log messages to file. Logs can be
 * manually flushed with `fileHandler.flush()`. Log messages with a log level
 * greater than ERROR are immediately flushed. Logs are also flushed on process
 * completion.
 *
 * Additional notes on `mode` as described above:
 *
 * - `'a'` Default mode. As above, this will pick up where the logs left off in
 *   rotation, or create a new log file if it doesn't exist.
 * - `'w'` in addition to starting with a clean `filename`, this mode will also
 *   cause any existing backups (up to `maxBackupCount`) to be deleted on setup
 *   giving a fully clean slate.
 * - `'x'` requires that neither `filename`, nor any backups (up to
 *   `maxBackupCount`), exist before setup.
 *
 * This handler requires both `--allow-read` and `--allow-write` permissions on
 * the log files.
