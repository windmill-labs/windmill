## Installation

Install the `wmill` CLI tool using
`deno install --unstable -A https://deno.land/x/wmill/main.ts`.

Update to the latest version using `wmill upgrade`.

## Workspaces

To get started run `wmill workspace add` or use the instructions from the
workspace settings.

## Running Flows & Scripts

Run a script or flow using `wmill flow/script run u/username/path/to/script` and
pass any inputs using `--input/-i <name>=<value>` curl-style syntax using
`-i @-` for stdin or `-i @<filename>` is also supported

Flow Steps and Logs will be streamed during execution automatically.

## Pushing Resources, Scripts & More

The CLI can push specifications to a windmill instance. See the
[examples/](./examples/) folder for formats.

## Switch to a different workspace

```
wmill workspace switch <workspace_name>
```

## Sync a workspace

### Pull

```
wmill sync pull
```

### Push

```
wmill sync push
```

### Pushing individual files

You can push individual resources using
`wmill <type> push <file_name> \<remote_name\>`. This does not require a special
folder layout or file name, as this is given at runtime.

## Listing

All commands support listing by just not providing a subcommand, ie
`wmill script` will result in a list of scripts. Some allow additional options,
learn about this by specifying `--help`.

## User Management

You can add & remove users via `wmill user add/remove`, and list them using
`wmill user`

## Pulling

You can pull the entire workspace using `wmill pull`

## Completion

The CLI comes with completions out of the box via `wmill completions <shell>`.
