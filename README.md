Open-source and self-hostable alternative to Airplane, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIs to trigger flows and scripts as internal apps. Convert code to no-code modules and, if the auto-generated UI is not sufficient, use it solely as a highly scalable backend layer. Add automation to your product or build your own no-code tool and delegate the core layer to Windmill. The script languages supported are: Python, Typescript and Go.

# Windmill

<p align="center">
<b>Disclaimer: </b>Windmill is in <b>BETA</b>. It is secure to run in production but we are still <a href="https://github.com/orgs/windmill-labs/projects/2">improving the product fast<a/>.
</p>

![Windmill Screenshot](./imgs/windmill.png)

Windmill is <b>fully open-sourced</b>:

- `community/`, `python-client/` and `deno-client/` are Apache 2.0
- backend, frontend and everything else under AGPLv3.

## What is the general idea behind Windmill

1. Define a minimal and generic script in Python, Typescript or Go that solves a
   specific task. Here sending an email with SMTP. The code can be defined in
   the provided Web IDE or synchronized with your own github repo:
   ![Step 1](./imgs/python-script.png)

2. Your scripts parameters are automatically parsed and generate a frontend. You
   can narrow down the types during task definition to specify regex for string,
   an enum or a specific format for objects. Each script correspond to an app by
   itself: ![Step 2](./imgs/arguments.png)

3. Make it flow! You can chain your scripts or scripts made by the community
   shared on [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev). There is tight integration
   between Windmill and the hub to make it easy to build flows from a soon-to-be
   exhaustive library of generic modules. In flows, one can pipe output to input
   using "Dynamic" expressions that are just plain Javascript underneath. Flows
   can contain for-loops, branching (coming soon). As such and coupled with
   inputs being able to refer to any step's output, they are actual DAG rather
   than just linear sequences. They are backed by an open JSON spec we call
   [OpenFlow](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/openflow)

Both scripts and flows are not restricted to be triggered by the UI. They can be
triggered by a schedule, watch for changes (using
[internal states](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/reference#internal-state)) or
triggered through API with either an async or sync webhook. The latter kind of
endpoints make Windmill akin to a self-hostable AWS Lambda. Windmill can be the
central place to host, build and run all of your integrations, automation and
internal apps. We include credentials management and OAuth integration, groups
and much more!

## Layout

- `backend/`: The whole Rust backend
- `frontend`: The whole Svelte frontend
- `community/`: Scripts and resource types included in every workspace. It is
  useful for Python scripts since the [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev)
  only allow deno scripts and for sharing resource types that will be included
  in every workspace.
- `lsp/`: The lsp asssistant for the monaco editor
- `nsjail/`: The nsjail configuration files for sandboxing of the scripts'
  execution
- `python-client/`: The wmill python client used within scripts to interact with
  the windmill platform
- `deno-client/`: The wmill deno client used within scripts to interact with the
  windmill platform

## Stack

- Postgres as the database
- backend in Rust with the following highly-available and horizontally scalable
  architecture:
  - stateless API backend
  - workers that pull jobs from a queue in Postgres (and later, Kafka or Redis.
    Upvote [#173](#https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/issues/173) if
    interested )
- frontend in Svelte
- scripts executions are sandboxed using google's
  [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)
- javascript runtime is the
  [deno_core rust library](https://denolib.gitbook.io/guide/) (which itself uses
  the [rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) and hence V8 underneath)
- typescript runtime is deno
- python runtime is python3

## Security

### Sandboxing and workload isolation

Windmill uses [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) on top of the deno
sandboxing. It is production multi-tenant grade secure. Do not take our word for
it, take [fly.io's one](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/)

### Secrets, credentials and sensitive values

There is one encryption key per workspace to encrypt the credentials and secrets
stored in Windmill's K/V store.

In addition, we strongly recommend that you encrypt the whole Postgres database.
That is what we do at <https://app.windmill.dev>.

## Performance

The performances are great, as long as you do not exceed the parallelism of the
workers, we are
[worse than AWS Lambda for small workloads but not by that much](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/benchmark)

## How to self-host

We only provide docker-compose setup here. For more advanced setups, like
compiling from source or using without a postgres super user, see
[documentation](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/how-tos/self_host)

### Docker compose

`docker compose up` with the following docker-compose is sufficient:
<https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/docker-compose.yml>

Go to https://localhost et voilà :)

For older kernels < 4.18, set `DISABLE_NUSER=true` as env variable, otherwise
nsjail will not be able to launch the isolated scripts.

To disable nsjail altogether, set `DISABLE_NSJAIL=true`.

The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / changeme

From there, you can create other users (do not forget to change the password!)

### Commercial license

To self-host Windmill, you must respect the terms of the AGPLv3 license which
you do not need to worry about for personal uses. For business uses, you should
be fine if you do not re-expose it in any way Windmill to your users and are
comfortable with AGPLv3.

To re-expose any Windmill parts to your users as a feature of your product, or
to build a feature on top of Windmill, to comply with AGPLv3 your product must
be AGPLv3 or you must get a commercial license. Contact us at
<license@windmill.dev> if you have any doubts.

In addition, a commercial license grants you a dedicated engineer to transition
your current infrastructure to Windmill, support with tight SLA, audit logs
export features, SSO, unlimited users creation, advanced permission managing features
such as groups and the ability to create more than one workspace.

### OAuth for self-hosting (very optional)

To get the same oauth integrations as Windmill Cloud, mount `oauth.json` with
the following format:

```json
{
  "<client>": {
    "id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "allowed_domains": ["windmill.dev"] //restrict a client OAuth login to some domains
  }
}
```

and mount it at `/usr/src/app/oauth.json`.

[The list of all possible "connect an app" oauth clients](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/backend/oauth_connect.json)

To add more "connect an app" OAuth clients to the Windmill project, read the
[Contributor's guide](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/contributors_guide). We
welcome contributions!

### Resource types

You will also want to import all the approved resource types from
[WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev). There is no automatic way to do this
automatically currently, but it will be possible using a command with the
upcoming CLI tool.

## Run a local dev setup

### only Frontend

This will use the backend of <https://app.windmill.dev> but your own frontend
with hot-code reloading.

1. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
2. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config CaddyfileRemote`
3. Et voilà, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`

### Backend + Frontend

See the [./frontend/README_DEV.md](./frontend/README_DEV.md) file for all
running options.

1. Create a Postgres Database for Windmill and create an admin role inside your
   Postgres setup.
   The easiest way to get a working postgres is running `cargo install sqlx-cli && sqlx migrate run`.
   This will also avoid compile time issue with sqlx's `query!` macro
2. Install [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) and have it accessible in
   your PATH
3. Install deno and python3, have the bins at `/usr/bin/deno` and
   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
4. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
5. Install the [lld linker](https://lld.llvm.org/)
6. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `npm run build` otherwise the backend will not find the `frontend/build` folder and will crash
   3. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config Caddyfile`
7. Go to `backend/`:
   `DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE_URL_TO_YOUR_WINDMILL_DB> RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
8. Et voilà, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`
