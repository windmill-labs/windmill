</p>

<p align=center>
Open-source developer infrastructure for internal tools (APIs, background jobs, workflows and UIs). Self-hostable alternative to Retool, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIs and custom UIs to trigger workflows and scripts as internal apps.

<p align=center>
Scripts are turned into sharable UIs automatically, and can be composed together into flows or used into richer apps built with low-code. Supported script languages supported are: Python, TypeScript, Go, Bash, SQL, and GraphQL.

## Main Concepts

1. Define a minimal and generic script in Python, TypeScript, Go or Bash that
   solves a specific task. The code can be defined in the
   [provided Web IDE](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/code_editor) or
   [synchronized with your own GitHub repo](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/cli/sync)
   (e.g. through
   [VS Code](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/cli_local_dev/vscode-extension)
   extension):

   ![Step 1](./imgs/windmill-editor.png)

2. Your scripts parameters are automatically parsed and
   [generate a frontend](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis).

![Step 2](./imgs/windmill-run.png)

![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-result.png)

3. Make it [flow](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/flows/flow_editor)! You can
   chain your scripts or scripts made by the community shared on
   [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev).

   ![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-flow.png)

4. Build [complex UIs](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/apps/app_editor) on top of
   your scripts and flows.

   ![Step 4](./imgs/windmill-builder.png)

Scripts and flows can also be triggered by a
[cron schedule](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/scheduling) (e.g.
'_/5 _ \* \* \*') or through
[webhooks](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/webhooks).

You can build your entire infra on top of Windmill!

## Show me some actual script code

```typescript
//import any dependency  from npm
import * as wmill from "windmill-client"
import * as cowsay from 'cowsay@1.5.0';

// fill the type, or use the +Resource type to get a type-safe reference to a resource
type Postgresql = {
  host: string;
  port: number;
  user: string;
  dbname: string;
  sslmode: string;
  password: string;
};

export async function main(
  a: number,
  b: "my" | "enum",
  c: Postgresql,
  d = "inferred type string from default arg",
  e = { nested: "object" }
  //f: wmill.Base64
) {
  const email = process.env["WM_EMAIL"];
  // variables are permissioned and by path
  let variable = await wmill.getVariable("f/company-folder/my_secret");
  const lastTimeRun = await wmill.getState();
  // logs are printed and always inspectable
  console.log(cowsay.say({ text: "hello " + email + " " + lastTimeRun }));
  await wmill.setState(Date.now());

  // return is serialized as JSON
  return { foo: d, variable };
}
```

## CLI

We have a powerful CLI to interact with the windmill platform and sync your scripts from local files, GitHub repos and to run scripts and flows on the instance from local commands. See
[more details](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/cli).

![CLI Screencast](./cli/vhs/output/setup.gif)

### Running scripts locally

You can run your script locally easily, you simply need to pass the right
environment variables for the `wmill` client library to fetch resources and
variables from your instance if necessary. See more:
<https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/local_development>.

To develop & test locally scripts & flows, we recommend using the Windmill VS
Code extension: <https://www.windmill.dev/docs/cli_local_dev/vscode-extension>.

## Stack

- Postgres as the database.
- Backend in Rust with the following highly-available and horizontally scalable.
  Architecture:
  - Stateless API backend.
  - Workers that pull jobs from a queue in Postgres (and later, Kafka or Redis.
    Upvote [#173](#https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/issues/173) if interested).
- Frontend in Svelte.
- Scripts executions are sandboxed using Google's
  [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail).
- Javascript runtime is the
  [deno_core rust library](https://denolib.gitbook.io/guide/) (which itself uses
  the [rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) and hence V8 underneath).
- TypeScript runtime is Bun and deno.
- Python runtime is python3.
- Golang runtime is 1.19.1.

## Fastest Self-Hostable Workflow Engine

We have compared Windmill to other self-hostable workflow engines (Airflow,
Prefect & Temporal) and Windmill is the most performant solution for both
benchmarks: one flow composed of 40 lightweight tasks & one flow composed of 10
long-running tasks.

All methodology & results on our
[Benchmarks](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/misc/benchmarks/competitors#airflow-setup)
page.

![Fastest workflow engine](./imgs/fastest.png)

## Security

### Sandboxing

Windmill can use [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail). It is production
multi-tenant grade secure. Do not take our word for it, take
[fly.io's one](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/).

### Secrets, credentials and sensitive values

There is one encryption key per workspace to encrypt the credentials and secrets
stored in Windmill's K/V store.

In addition, we strongly recommend that you encrypt the whole Postgres database.
That is what we do at <https://app.windmill.dev>.

## Performance

Once a job started, there is no overhead compared to running the same script on
the node with its corresponding runner (Deno/Go/Python/Bash). The added latency
from a job being pulled from the queue, started, and then having its result sent
back to the database is ~50ms. A typical lightweight deno job will take around
100ms total.

## How to self-host

We only provide docker-compose setup here. For more advanced setups, like
compiling from source or using without a postgres super user, see
[Self-Host documentation](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host).

### Docker compose

Windmill can be deployed using 3 files:
([docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml), [Caddyfile](./Caddyfile) and a
[.env](./.env)) in a single command.

Make sure Docker is started, and run:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile -o Caddyfile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env -o .env

docker compose up -d
```

Go to http://localhost et voil√† :)

The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / changeme.

From there, you can follow the setup app and create other users.

More details in
[Self-Host Documention](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host#docker).

### Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm charts

We publish helm charts at:
<https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts>.

### Run from binaries

Each release includes the corresponding binaries for x86_64. You can simply
download the latest `windmill` binary using the following set of bash commands.

```bash
BINARY_NAME='windmill-amd64' # or windmill-ee-amd64 for the enterprise edition
LATEST_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases/latest)
LATEST_VERSION=$(echo $LATEST_RELEASE | sed -e 's/.*"tag_name":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')
ARTIFACT_URL="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases/download/$LATEST_VERSION/$BINARY_NAME"
wget "$ARTIFACT_URL" -O windmill
```

### OAuth, SSO & SMTP

Windmill Community Edition allows to configure the OAuth, SSO (including Google
Workspace SSO, Microsoft/Azure and Okta) directly from the UI in the superadmin
settings. Do note that there is a limit of 10 SSO users on the community
edition.

[See documentation](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/misc/setup_oauth).

### Commercial license

To self-host Windmill, you must respect the terms of the
[AGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) which you do not
need to worry about for personal uses. For business uses, you should be fine if
you do not re-expose Windmill in any way to your users and are comfortable with
AGPLv3.

To
[re-expose any Windmill parts to your users](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/misc/white_labelling)
as a feature of your product, or to build a feature on top of Windmill, to
comply with AGPLv3 your product must be AGPLv3 or you must get a commercial
license. Contact us at <ruben@windmill.dev> if you have any doubts.

In addition, a commercial license grants you a dedicated engineer to transition
your current infrastructure to Windmill, support with tight SLA, and our global
cache sync for high-performance/no dependency cache miss of cluster from 10+
nodes to 200+ nodes.

### Integrations

In Windmill, integrations are referred to as
[resources and resource types](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/resources_and_types).
Each Resource has a Resource Type that defines the schema that the resource
needs to implement.

On self-hosted instances, you might want to import all the approved resource
types from [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev). A setup script will prompt
you to have it being synced automatically everyday.

## Run a local dev setup
### only Frontend
This will use the backend of <https://app.windmill.dev> but your own frontend
with hot-code reloading.
1. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
2. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config CaddyfileRemote`
3. Et voil√†, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`
### Backend + Frontend
See the [./frontend/README_DEV.md](./frontend/README_DEV.md) file for all
running options.
1. Create a Postgres Database for Windmill and create an admin role inside your
   Postgres setup.
   The easiest way to get a working db is to run
	```
   cargo install sqlx-cli
   env DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL> sqlx migrate run
	```
   This will also avoid compile time issue with sqlx's `query!` macro
2. Install [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) and have it accessible in
   your PATH
3. Install deno and python3, have the bins at `/usr/bin/deno` and
   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
4. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
5. Install the [lld linker](https://lld.llvm.org/)
6. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. You might need to set some extra heap space for the node runtime `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"`
   3. In another shell `npm run build` otherwise the backend will not find the `frontend/build` folder and will not compile.
   4. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config Caddyfile`
7. Go to `backend/`:
   `env DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE_URL_TO_YOUR_WINDMILL_DB> RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
8. Et voil√†, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`
