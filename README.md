Open-source developer infrastructure for internal tools. Self-hostable alternative to Airplane, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIsm and custom UIs to trigger workflows and scripts as internal apps.

<p align=center>
Scripts are turned into UIs and no-code modules, no-code modules can be composed into very rich flows, and script and flows can be triggered from internal UIs made with a low-code builder. The script languages supported are: Python, TypeScript, Go, Bash, SQL. Scripts can be generated by an AI assistant powered by OpenAI.

## Main Concepts

1. Define a minimal and generic script in Python, TypeScript, Go or Bash that
   solves a specific task. Here sending a POST request. The code can be defined
   in the provided Web IDE or synchronized with your own github repo:
   ![Step 1](./imgs/windmill-editor.png)

2. Your scripts parameters are automatically parsed and generate a frontend.
   ![Step 2](./imgs/windmill-run.png) ![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-result.png)

3. Make it flow! You can chain your scripts or scripts made by the community
   shared on [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev).
   ![Step 3](./imgs/windmill-flow.png)

4. Build complex UIs on top of your scripts and flows.
   ![Step 4](./imgs/windmill-builder.png)

Scripts and flows can also be triggered by a cron schedule '_/5 _ \* \* \*' or
through webhooks.

You can build your entire infra on top of Windmill!

## Show me some actual script code

```typescript
//import any dependency  from npm
import * as wmill from "https://deno.land/x/windmill@v1.136.0/mod.ts";
import cowsay from "npm:cowsay@1.5.0";

// fill the type, or use the +Resource type to get a type-safe reference to a resource
type Postgresql = {
  host: string;
  port: number;
  user: string;
  dbname: string;
  sslmode: string;
  password: string;
};

export async function main(
  a: number,
  b: "my" | "enum",
  c: Postgresql,
  d = "inferred type string from default arg",
  e = { nested: "object" }
  //f: wmill.Base64
) {
  const email = Deno.env.get("WM_EMAIL");
  // variables are permissioned and by path
  let variable = await wmill.getVariable("f/company-folder/my_secret");
  const lastTimeRun = await wmill.getState();
  // logs are printed and always inspectable
  console.log(cowsay.say({ text: "hello " + email + " " + lastTimeRun }));
  await wmill.setState(Date.now());

  // return is serialized as JSON
  return { foo: d, variable };
}
```

## CLI

We have a powerful CLI to interact with the windmill platform and sync your
scripts from local files, github repos and to run scripts and flows on the
instance from local commands. See
[more details](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/tree/main/cli).

![CLI Screencast](./cli/vhs/output/setup.gif)

### Running scripts locally

You can run your script locally easily, you simply need to pass the right
environment variables for the `wmill` client library to fetch resources and
variables from your instance if necessary. See more:
<https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/local_development/>.

## Stack

- Postgres as the database
- backend in Rust with the following highly-available and horizontally scalable
  architecture:
  - stateless API backend
  - workers that pull jobs from a queue in Postgres (and later, Kafka or Redis.
    Upvote [#173](#https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/issues/173) if
    interested )
- frontend in Svelte
- scripts executions are sandboxed using google's
  [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail)
- javascript runtime is the
  [deno_core rust library](https://denolib.gitbook.io/guide/) (which itself uses
  the [rusty_v8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) and hence V8 underneath)
- typescript runtime is deno
- python runtime is python3
- golang runtime is 1.19.1

## Security

### Sandboxing

Windmill uses [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) and deno's sandboxing
capabilities. It is production multi-tenant grade secure. Do not take our word
for it, take
[fly.io's one](https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/).

### Secrets, credentials and sensitive values

There is one encryption key per workspace to encrypt the credentials and secrets
stored in Windmill's K/V store.

In addition, we strongly recommend that you encrypt the whole Postgres database.
That is what we do at <https://app.windmill.dev>.

## Performance

Once a job started, there is no overhead compared to running the same script on
the node with its corresponding runner (Deno/Go/Python/Bash). The added latency
from a job being pulled from the queue, started, and then having its result sent
back to the database is ~50ms. A typical lightweight deno job will take around
100ms total.

## Architecture

## How to self-host

We only provide docker-compose setup here. For more advanced setups, like
compiling from source or using without a postgres super user, see
[documentation](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host).

### Docker compose

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile -o Caddyfile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env -o .env

docker compose up -d
```

Go to http://localhost et voil√† :)

The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / changeme.

From there, you can follow the setup app and create other users.

### Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm charts

We publish helm charts at:
<https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts>.

### Run from binaries

Each release includes the corresponding binaries for x86_64. You can simply
download the latest `windmill` binary using the following set of bash commands.

```bash
BINARY_NAME='windmill-amd64' # or windmill-ee-amd64 for the enterprise edition
LATEST_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases/latest)
LATEST_VERSION=$(echo $LATEST_RELEASE | sed -e 's/.*"tag_name":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')
ARTIFACT_URL="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases/download/$LATEST_VERSION/$BINARY_NAME"
wget "$ARTIFACT_URL" -O windmill
```

### OAuth, SSO & SMTP

Windmill Community Edition allows to configure the OAuth, SSO (including Google
Workspace SSO, Microsoft/Azure and Okta) directly from the UI in the superadmin
settings. Do note that there is a limit of 50 SSO users on the community
edition.

### Commercial license

To self-host Windmill, you must respect the terms of the AGPLv3 license which
you do not need to worry about for personal uses. For business uses, you should
be fine if you do not re-expose it in any way Windmill to your users and are
comfortable with AGPLv3.

To re-expose any Windmill parts to your users as a feature of your product, or
to build a feature on top of Windmill, to comply with AGPLv3 your product must
be AGPLv3 or you must get a commercial license. Contact us at
<ruben@windmill.dev> if you have any doubts.

In addition, a commercial license grants you a dedicated engineer to transition
your current infrastructure to Windmill, support with tight SLA, and our global
cache sync for high-performance/no dependency cache miss of cluster from 10+
nodes to 200+ nodes.

### Resource types

You will also want to import all the approved resource types from
[WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev). A setup script will prompt you to have
it being synced automatically everyday.

## Run a local dev setup

### only Frontend

This will use the backend of <https://app.windmill.dev> but your own frontend
with hot-code reloading.

1. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`
   2. `npm run generate-backend-client`
   3. `npm run dev`
2. Et voil√†, windmill should be available at `http://localhost:3000/`

### Backend + Frontend

See the [./frontend/README_DEV.md](./frontend/README_DEV.md) file for all
running options.

1. Create a Postgres Database for Windmill and create an admin role inside your
   Postgres setup. The easiest way to get a working postgres is running
   `cargo install --version ^0.7 sqlx-cli && sqlx migrate run`. This will also
   avoid compile time issue with sqlx's `query!` macro
2. Install [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) and have it accessible in
   your PATH
3. Install deno and python3, have the bins at `/usr/bin/deno` and
   `/usr/local/bin/python3`
4. Install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
5. Go to `frontend/`:
   1. `npm install`, `npm run generate-backend-client` then `npm run dev`
   2. In another shell `npm run build` otherwise the backend will not find the
      `frontend/build` folder and will crash
   3. In another shell `sudo caddy run --config Caddyfile`
6. Go to `backend/`:
   `DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE_URL_TO_YOUR_WINDMILL_DB> RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
7. Et voil√†, windmill should be available at `http://localhost/`
