/**
 * <p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign user access to
 *       IAM Identity Center resources such as the AWS access portal. Users can get AWS account applications and roles
 *       assigned to them and get federated into the application.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
 *           <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for
 *         backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>This reference guide describes the IAM Identity Center Portal operations that you can call
 *       programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
 *         languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a
 *         convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other AWS services. For more
 *         information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
