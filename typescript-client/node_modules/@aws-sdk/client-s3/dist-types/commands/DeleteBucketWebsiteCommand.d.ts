 *          <p>This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a <code>200
 *             OK</code> response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified
 *          bucket. You will get a <code>200 OK</code> response if the website configuration you are
 *          trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a <code>404</code> response if
 *          the bucket specified in the request does not exist.</p>
 *          <p>This DELETE action requires the <code>S3:DeleteBucketWebsite</code> permission. By
 *          default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket.
 *          However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration
 *          by writing a bucket policy granting them the <code>S3:DeleteBucketWebsite</code>
 *          permission. </p>
