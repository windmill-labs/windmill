 * ```javascript

 * // const { S3Client, DeleteBucketReplicationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new S3Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteBucketReplicationRequest
 *   Bucket: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ExpectedBucketOwner: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteBucketReplicationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteBucketReplicationCommandInput - {@link DeleteBucketReplicationCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteBucketReplicationCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteBucketReplicationCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteBucketReplicationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link S3ClientResolvedConfig | config} for S3Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link S3ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from S3 service.</p>
 *
 * @example To delete bucket replication configuration
 * ```javascript
 * // The following example deletes replication configuration set on bucket.
 * const input = {
 *   "Bucket": "example"
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteBucketReplicationCommand(input);
 * await client.send(command);
