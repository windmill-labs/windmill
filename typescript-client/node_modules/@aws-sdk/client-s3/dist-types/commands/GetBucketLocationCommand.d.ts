 *          <p>Returns the Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket's Region using the
 *             <code>LocationConstraint</code> request parameter in a <code>CreateBucket</code>
 *          request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html">CreateBucket</a>.</p>
 *          <p>When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.</p>
 *          <p>When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name.
 * If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code <code>InvalidAccessPointAliasError</code> is returned.
 * For more information about <code>InvalidAccessPointAliasError</code>, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList">List of
 *             Error Codes</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>We recommend that you use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html">HeadBucket</a> to return the Region
 *             that a bucket resides in. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support
 *             GetBucketLocation.</p>
