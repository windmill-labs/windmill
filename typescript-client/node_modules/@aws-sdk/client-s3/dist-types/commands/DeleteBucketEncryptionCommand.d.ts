 *          <p>This implementation of the DELETE action resets the default encryption for the bucket as
 *          server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). For information about the bucket
 *          default encryption feature, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html">Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption</a>
 *          in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
 *             <code>s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission
 *          by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information
 *          about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources">Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html">Managing

 * const command = new DeleteBucketEncryptionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
