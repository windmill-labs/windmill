 * (Thanks #TypescriptTeam for not being standard, look at all the additional work you make me do!)
 * (All this work for three stupid letters!...)
 * (Love your work though, Typescript is an awesome language <3)
 * This utility function can be used after a Typescript compilation to add the mandatory '.js'
