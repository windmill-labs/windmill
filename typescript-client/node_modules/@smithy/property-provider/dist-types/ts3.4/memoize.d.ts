     * @param isExpired         A function that will evaluate the resolved value and
     *                          determine if it is expired. For example, when
     *                          memoizing AWS credential providers, this function
     *                          should return `true` when the credential's
     *                          expiration is in the past (or very near future) and
     *                          `false` otherwise.
     * @param requiresRefresh   A function that will evaluate the resolved value and
     *                          determine if it represents static value or one that
     *                          will eventually need to be refreshed. For example,
     *                          AWS credentials that have no defined expiration will
     *                          never need to be refreshed, so this function would
     *                          return `true` if the credentials resolved by the
     *                          underlying provider had an expiration and `false`
     *                          otherwise.
