# Windmill API Client

This holds an autogenerated OpenAPI client in Rust. It's exclusively used in the backend to talk to the [api server](../windmill-api/).

## Generate

Simply run `sh bundle.sh` to update bundled.json. The source code will automatically update.
This requires the swagger-cli to be installed for bundling.
