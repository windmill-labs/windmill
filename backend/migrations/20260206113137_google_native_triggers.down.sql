-- Note: PostgreSQL does not support removing enum values directly.
-- This down migration is a placeholder. To fully reverse, you would need to:
-- 1. Create a new enum type without the values
-- 2. Update all columns to use the new type
-- 3. Drop the old type
-- 4. Rename the new type

-- For now, we just document what was added:
-- Removed from native_trigger_service: 'google', 'google_drive', 'google_calendar'
-- Removed from TRIGGER_KIND: 'google_drive', 'google_calendar'
-- Removed from job_trigger_kind: 'google_drive', 'google_calendar'
