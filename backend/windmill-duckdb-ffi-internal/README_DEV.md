This crate is compiled separately because it causes nasty issues when compiled with the deno_core feature flag enabled (lib c++ interactions).

The main issue was :
Errors in DuckDB always worked correctly, except when attached to a Ducklake and when the deno_core feature flag was set.
For example:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake' AS dl; USE dl;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t (x string not null);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL);
```

causes `Constraint Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: t.x` normally, but here we see `Unknown exception in ExecutorTask::Execute`. This opaque errors comes directly from the C++ DuckDB library : https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/f99fed1e0b16a842573f9dad529f6c170a004f6e/src/parallel/executor_task.cpp#L58

To solve this, we compile duckdb separately from the main backend crate and call it with FFI
